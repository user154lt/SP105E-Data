# SP105E-Data
This repo contains the data required to control SP105E lights, for all commands there are some seemingly random bytes I have inserted the byte 0x9A but I am pretty sure you could substitute this for any value of your choosing.

You will find the service and characteristic UUIDs in the [SP105EDataProvider](SP105EDataProvider.kt) class.
